# QCSchema
A Key-Value/Array Schema for Quantum Chemistry

The purpose of this schema is to provide API like access to pre-existing quantum
chemistry packages to enable more complex workflows.  The core of this is to
avoid parsing ASCII-based output files and place output variables, vectors,
matrices in a consistent format that can be easily parsed.

Please see the [website](http://molssi-qc-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) for the current specification.
